# Tic-Tac-Toe https://hyperskill.org/projects/48

## Stage 1
Your first task in this project is to print the game grid in the console output. Use what you’ve learned about the `print()` function to print three lines, each containing three characters (X’s and O’s) to represent a game of tic-tac-toe where all fields of the grid have been filled in.

## Stage 2
In this stage, you will write a program that:

1. Reads a string of 9 symbols from the input and displays them to the user in a 3x3 grid. The grid can contain only `X`, `O` and `_` symbols.
2. Outputs a line of dashes `---------` above and below the grid, adds a pipe `|` symbol to the beginning and end of each line of the grid, and adds a space between all characters in the grid.
