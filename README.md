# Tic-Tac-Toe https://hyperskill.org/projects/48

## Stage 1
Your first task in this project is to print the game grid in the console output. Use what you’ve learned about the `print()` function to print three lines, each containing three characters (X’s and O’s) to represent a game of tic-tac-toe where all fields of the grid have been filled in.
